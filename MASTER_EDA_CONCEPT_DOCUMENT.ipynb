    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing datasets to summarize their main characteristics. Itâ€™s a critical step in any machine learning or data science workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why EDA is Important:\n",
    "- Understand data quality, shape, and structure\n",
    "- Identify data issues early (missing values, outliers, skewness)\n",
    "- Discover patterns, correlations, and feature-target relationships\n",
    "- Generate hypotheses and insights to guide modeling decisions\n",
    "- Reduce risk of data leakage and modeling bias\n"
